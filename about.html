          <h1> About the Artist</h1>
          <p> Lena Nazaryan started drawing from the young age of seven. After attending years of private art class, she prepped proffesionaly with an acclaimed artist to develop her skills, and prepare for more advanced studies. She learned about the human figure, still lifes, and landscapes. She took specialized exams and got into LaGuardia Highschool to major in art. While studying there, she spent her evenings taking classes at the Art Students League in the heart of New York City. Lena took a break from art while she was majoring in Humanities and Psychology during college, but a year before graduating, she decided that art was her life-long passion and switched majors. She now works proffesionaly as an artist, creating pieces for new collections to be shared with her online community. 
          </p>

          <p> Like everyone else, she continues learning and improving each day. Lena believes humans are like art, and that we are all works in progress. Because of this, she advises that everyone should strive for the best every day to get closer to themselves. She believes there is no end goal in life and in art, and that we as humans should enjoy the journey and process.</p>
